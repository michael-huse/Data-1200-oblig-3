        Dive into Digital Inclusion: Our Accessible Web Wonderland
      </h1>
      <h2>Hi!</h2>

      <p class="introduction">
        Welcome to our webpage! Today I want to tell you about what measure we
        took to obtain accessibility and universal design for our web page.
      </p>

      <h3>Research</h3>
      <p>
        In this part of the exam, we are going to tell you how we checked the
        coding choices we made for our pages. For the testing of our web pages,
        we used Lighthouse extension on Chrome that will generate a report based
        on the testing of our code. This will give us an idea of how the page
        site will perform, if its accessible, see best practice and SEO.
      </p>
      <p>
        The checks ensure that our page is following basic search engine
        optimization advice.
      </p>

      <!--aside defines some content aside from the content it is placed

          Web accessbility is about making sure that websites, applications and
          webtools are designed in such a way that anyone can use them, no
          matter software, hardware, vision, hearing, cognitive abilities etc.
        </p>
      </aside>

      <p>
        After running the test, we were looking at feedback and texts to look at
        suggestions on how to make our pages better. For instance, we tested our
        topical page and Lighthouse made comments on how our image lacked an alt
        attribute. We also got feedback that the heading elements were not in a
        sequentially descending order which could be a very and basic mistake.
      </p>

      <p>
        After fixing the comments from Lighthouse, our topical page got a better
        score overall and 100 on Accessibility which was the aim. We did similar
        testing for the other pages as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, we tested our colors with the web page webaim.org with
        their contrast checker. The footer for index page and navigation link
        has great contrasting colors according to this page. While as the footer
        colors for the other pages did not pass all the contrast check
        requirements. We also had ensured that images were not passed 1MB
        because of the formal requirements of this exam. We chose to change the
        transparency of the image, so it did not clash with the text we wanted
        on the index/front page. We also took some of the text from OsloMet
        website as a inspiration source on what to write in the welcoming page.
        Regarding accessibility and readability for the code in both HTML and
        CSS we agreed that the index/front page should be in a different styling
        as it is the first page that welcomes the examiners. The index styling
        therefore has the class name index with a following explanation of what
        part of the index is styled, besides the navigation links. Additionally,
        we noticed that for the next time we do a web project, we should code
        something together as it is more efficient to agree on the styling in
        person. To conclude this text, we would say that Lighthouse as a tool
        has been quite useful to test and get feedback on the pages. This is a
        tool we want to use in the future, as well as the contrast color
        checker.
