        Dive into Digital Inclusion: My Accessible Web Wonderland
      </h1>
      <h2>Hi!</h2>

      <p>
        Welcome to our webpage! Today I want to tell you about what measure we
        took to obtain accessibility and universal design for our web page.
      </p>

      <p>
        We started by conducting some research about general good practice. This
        led us to a few reliable sources which we settled on, and based on these
        we have shaped a webpage we believe to be accessible to a broad
        audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of our design choices and general actions towards accesibility are:
      </p>

      <ul class="accesibility">
        <li>
          Following general guidelines such as correct use of white space, high
          contrast colors, correct use of heading levels and semantic elements
          and so on.
        </li>
        <li>High contrast colors</li>
        <li>White space</li>
        <li>Text big enough to be read on any screen by most users.</li>
        <li>Visible indication of focus.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Further more we tested our website up against severel accesibility
        tools, which provided valuable feedback. This feedback was used to
        further develop the webpage. These are some of the changes we had to
        make:
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally we usertested the webpage with a handfull of users with
        different backgrounds to see if the webpage was accessible to them all.
        Although this is a limited amount of usecases, it proivded valuable
        feedback to improve our webpage further.
